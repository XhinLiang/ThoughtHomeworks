## Problem Two: Conference Track Management

#### Description
You are planning a big programming conference and have received many proposals which have passed the initial screen process but you're having trouble fitting them into the time constraints of the day -- there are so many possibilities! So you write a program to do it for you.

- The conference has multiple tracks each of which has a morning and afternoon session.
- Each session contains multiple talks.
- Morning sessions begin at 9am and must finish by 12 noon, for lunch.
- Afternoon sessions begin at 1pm and must finish in time for the networking event.
- The networking event can start no earlier than 4:00 and no later than 5:00.
- No talk title has numbers in it.
- All talk lengths are either in minutes (not hours) or lightning (5 minutes).
- Presenters will be very punctual; there needs to be no gap between sessions.

Note that depending on how you choose to complete this problem, your solution may give a different ordering or combination of talks into tracks. This is acceptable; you donâ€™t need to exactly duplicate the sample output given here.

### Run Tips
Notice there may be some incompatible property between different environments.
My build environment:
- Intel i5-3380m @2.9GHz
- Ubuntu 14.04 LTS 64bit
- Oracle JDK 8u101 64bit
- Gradle 2.14.1
- JUnit 4.11

#### Install Gradle and Oracle-JDK 8
It's very easy to do this.

#### Build
``` bash
gradle build
```
> The Unit Test will be run when the project is building.
> You can find the test report in `out/reports/tests`

#### Run
**With your manual input.**
``` bash
java -jar out/libs/thoughthomeworks-1.0.jar
```

**With your input text file.**
``` bash
java -jar out/libs/thoughthomeworks-1.0.jar < /path/to/your/file
```
